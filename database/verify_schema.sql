-- 1. Table Verification
SELECT 
    table_name,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.columns c WHERE c.table_schema = 'public' AND c.table_name = t.table_name) AS column_count
FROM information_schema.tables t
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- 2. Foreign Key Constraints
SELECT
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name,
    rc.delete_rule
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
JOIN information_schema.referential_constraints AS rc
    ON tc.constraint_name = rc.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
    AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND tc.table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY tc.table_name, kcu.column_name;

-- 3. Indexes Count & List
SELECT
    tablename,
    indexname,
    indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;

-- 4. Triggers Verification
SELECT
    event_object_table AS table_name,
    trigger_name,
    event_manipulation AS event,
    action_timing AS timing
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY event_object_table, trigger_name;
